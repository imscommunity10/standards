  "Who is this task organized by?": "Community",
  "Name of the Task?": "Gaza and the Big Problem",
  "Problem Statement?": "The Muslim Ummah lacks real power and influence today, which is most painfully visible in crises like Gaza. Despite our emotions and support, we remain helpless because we:\n\nAre mentally stuck in defeatist mindsets,\n\nAre disconnected from real knowledge and from one another,\n\nLack critical skills and tools,\n\nBelieve in incorrect ideas without questioning them,\n\nOften prioritize self-interest over collective unity.\n\nWithout addressing these roots, no real change can happen â€” and our emotional reactions alone won't solve the problem.",
  "Purpose / Goal of the Task?": "To empower the Ummah through deep, honest, and research-based understanding of the historical, political, and ideological roots of the Gaza crisis and the larger power imbalance â€” so that we can move from emotional reaction to intellectual clarity, confident speech, and effective action.",
  "Objectives": "Mental Clarity: Break free from defeatist mindsets by confronting the root causes of our weakness.\n\nDeep Understanding: Study the historical, political, and religious context of the Israel-Palestine conflict, starting with open questions, not conclusions.\n\nKnowledge-Based Unity: Foster collective learning through shared research, respectful discussion, and fact-based collaboration.\n\nSkill Development: Learn to communicate clearly and factually, counter misinformation, and raise awareness.\n\nNarrative Building: Begin forming our own strong, united narratives to counter the dominant pro-Israel discourse in global media and politics.",
  "Expected or Achieved Outcomes?": "By the end of this journey, participants will:\n\nBe intellectually equipped to discuss Palestine/Gaza with confidence and evidence.\n\nUnderstand the layers of history, Zionism, Western involvement, and media manipulation.\n\nBe able to respond calmly and factually to arguments, misinformation, or bias.\n\nShare accurate knowledge within their circles, online and offline.\n\nBegin forming solutions and collective strategies rooted in truth and unity.\n\nFeel emotionally grounded and mentally empowered, InshaAllah.\n",

  "Task's Description": "This task is a research-based initiative aimed at empowering the Muslim Ummah by addressing the root causes of our collective weakness â€” especially in the context of Gaza and Palestine. While we feel deep pain and frustration at global injustice, emotional responses alone are not enough. Real change requires knowledge, clarity, and unity.\n\nThrough weekly study sessions, shared resources, and honest discussions, we will explore key historical and political questions â€” from the origins of Zionism to modern-day media control. The goal is to move beyond surface-level reactions and develop a deep, fact-based understanding of the conflict and the power structures behind it.\n\nThis journey begins with sincerity and ends with strength â€” the strength to speak with wisdom, to respond with evidence, and to work toward real, long-term solutions for our Ummah, InshaAllah.",
